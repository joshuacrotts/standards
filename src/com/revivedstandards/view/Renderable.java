Standards is the long-overdue update to the everlasting Standards 2.0 library
Andrew Matzureff and I created two years ago. I am including it in this project
to simplify the rendering and logic pipeline, but with a focus on the MVC
paradigm.

We connect to the Apache FastMath API for some of our trigonometric functions,
and we use John Carmack's fast inverse square root function.
