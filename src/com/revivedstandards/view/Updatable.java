Standards is the long-overdue update to the everlasting Standards 2.0 library
Andrew Matzureff and I created two years ago. I am including it in this project
to simplify the rendering and logic pipeline, but with a focus on the MVC
paradigm.

We connect to the Apache FastMath API for some of our trigonometric functions,
and we use John Carmack's fast inverse square root function. Lastly, for 
StandardAudio, we use the javax.sound (Trail's Sound) Oracle API.
